# Summary

The DataLad project ([datalad.org](http://datalad.org)) adapted the models of open-source software development and distribution to address technical limitations of today's data management, sharing, and provenance collection.
Born from the idea to provide a unified data distribution for neuroscience, taking a versatile system for data logistics
([git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com)) built on top of the most popular distributed version control system 
([Git](https://git-scm.com)), and adopting ideas and procedures from software distributions, DataLad delivers a completely open, pioneering platform for flexible decentralized research data management (dRDM) [@Hanke_2021].

# Statement of Need

Code, data, and computing environments are at the core of scientific practice, and unobstructed access and efficient management of all those digital objects promotes scientific discovery through collaboration, reproducibility, and replicability. 
While software development and sharing are streamlined with the advance of software distributions, distributed version control systems, and social coding portals like GitHub, data have remained a “2nd-class citizen” in the contemporary scientific process, despite FAIR principles [@FAIR2016] postulating demands on public data hosting portals and the big callout for Data Science.
Disconnected data hosting portals provide a cacophony of data access and authentication methods, data versioning is frequently ignored, and data provenance---if shared at all---is often not recoverable simply because data management is rarely considered to be an integral part of the scientific process.
<!-- MIH summary: inconvenient access, version/provenenance information unavailable -->
DataLad aims to solve these issues by streamlining data consumption, publication, and updating routines, by providing simplified core interfaces for Git and git-annex operations, and by providing additional features for reproducible science such as command execution provenance capturing and making re-execution possible.
Since it is interoperable with a large variety of scientific and commercial hosting services and available for all operating systems, DataLad can be integrated into established systems with minimal adjustments.

## Why Git and git-annex

Git is an excellent <!-- citation needed -->distributed content management system geared towards managing and collaborating on text files <!-- citation needed, does not match self-description -->, but it is not designed to handle large (e.g., over a gigabyte) or binary files efficiently [see, e.g., @opensource:git-binary].
<!-- YOH: I do not think we need citation to support ever statement, especially for which there would be no scholary articly "deeply investigating" it.  Added a citation to some first hit on google -->
Moreover, any data committed to Git becomes available to all clones of that repository.
This makes it hard or impossible to provide distributed storage of managed data <!-- why? individual tailoring is hard, but distribution not, what is special about scientific data in this regard? YOH: "distributed storage" != "distribution". Removed "scientic data" preamble and otherwise I think this statement is ok otherwise--> or to stop providing some individual files, such as accidentally stored personal data or data from participants that withdrew from a study.
Git-annex takes advantage of Git's ability to efficiently manage textual information to overcome Git's limitation in managing individual file content that is either large or sensitive.
File content managed by git-annex is placed into an annex, and in its place, git-annex commits a link (a symbolic link or a git link) <!-- km: think "or a git link" might be too into the weeds; drop (...) entirely? --> pointing to the content of the file.
The content representation is based on a checksum of the file's content.
As such, while only a lightweight link is directly committed into Git, this committed information contains the content identity of annexed files.
Git-annex then manages content availability information in any local repository, other Git remotes, or external resources such as web urls.
Having that information, git-annex takes care of all transport logistics to exchange content upon user request.
This simple approach allows git-annex to manage and version control virtually arbitrarily large files, and "link" files in a Git repository to vast data resources available online.
<!-- BEN thinks we need to make explicit the idea, that by means of how annex
works, the content and access control to it is separated from the version
control (and metadata). ATM this follows implicitly but may be much less obvious
to someone who didn't dive into it yet -->

## Why Git and git-annex alone are not enough

<!-- this is "what does datalad add to Git+git-annex -->
<!-- MIH thinks: #1 nesting, #2 reproducible execution, #3 additional software adaptors for concrete services relevant for science -->

**They are generic and lack support for domain-specific solutions.** 
Git can interact with other repositories on the file system or accessible via a set of standard (ssh, http) or custom (Git) network transport protocols.
Interaction with non git-aware portals should then be implemented via custom Git transfer protocols, as, e.g., it was done in datalad-osf [@datalad-osf:zenodo].
Git-annex provides access to a wide range of external data storage resources via various protocols but cannot implement all idiosyncrasies of any individual data portal.
In particular, scientific data is frequently stored in compressed archives to reduce its storage demands, and/or on specialized servers, such as XNAT ([www.xnat.org](http://www.xnat.org)).
To address these demands, git-annex established a protocol [@git-annex:special_remotes_protocol] through which external tools can provide custom transport functionality transparently to the git-annex user.
This allowed DataLad and many other projects to facilitate access to an ever-growing collection of resources [@git-annex:special_remotes] and to overcome technological limitations (e.g., maximal file sizes, or file system inode limits).

**They require a layer above to establish a *distribution*.**
The DataLad project's initial goal was to provide a data distribution with unified access to already available public data archives in neuroscience, such as [crcns.org](http://crcns.org) and [openfmri.org](http://openfmri.org).
On their own, Git and git-annex do not provide user interfaces for search across available repositories or for convenient manipulation of individual components of a data distribution. 
[datasets.datalad.org](http://datasets.datalad.org) became an example of such a data distribution curated by the DataLad team, which at the moment provides streamlined access to over 250 TBs of data across wide range of projects and archives.
<!-- MIH thinks this needs a clarification of terms. If datasets.d.o is a distribution than datalad is "just a client tool" too. I think this is probably aimed at the nesting feature, and if so, we should use the term, because people can read about it in the handbook. This technical feature is then what is used to build a "unified data distribution" -->
<!-- YOH: good point, after all every distribution relies on client tools.  I have tried to address it above by removing the notion of "just a client tool".
 I do not think we can escape "metadata" completely -->
<!-- BEN adds to MIH: below we call ds.dl.org a testament of scalability, and
this is what I think it is. A showcase, not somehow a central or special part of
DataLad itself. Therefore I'd present it as the conclusion of what that
modularization allows for. Overall the "additional layer" the headline talks
about is not clear to me.-->
<!-- YOH: IMHO modularization is IMHO a very related but different aspect from "distribution"
 which is largely about bringing components from different resources together under a unified interface,
 with mechanisms to declare relationships (dependencies), often versioning, and then some notion of convenient URIs (package names vs urls).
 Any distribution indeed needs some level of modularization.
 As those are two aspects are very related, order could be swapped, but then we would need to re-work out "cross-referencing" -->

**Modularization is needed to scale.**
Research workflows impose additional demands for an efficient research data management (RDM) platform besides "version control" and "data transport".
Many research datasets contain millions of files, and that precludes placing such datasets in their entirety within a single Git repository even if individual files are tiny in their size.
Such datasets should be partitioned into smaller subdatasets (e.g., a subdataset per each subject in the dataset comprising thousands of participants).
This modularization allows for not only scalable management, <!-- unclear how management of 10k small pieces becomes more scalable than one piece with 10k parts; YOH: just by virtue of being able to handle 10k * 10k files --> but also for the efficient reuse of a selected subset of datasets.
DataLad uses Git's submodule mechanism to unambiguously link (versions of) individual datasets into larger super-datasets, and further simplifies working with the resulting hierarchies of datasets with recursive operations across dataset boundaries.
<!-- BEN: There are more aspect of modularization than reuse and large-scale.
Most importantly, that's the notions of dependencies and a derivative
relationsship that can be expressed that way, I think. -->
<!-- YOH: well, there is "unambiguously link (versions of) " in above.  Could indeed be elaborated -->
With this, DataLad makes it trivial to operate on individual files deep in the hierarchy or entire sub-trees of datasets, providing a "mono-repo"-like user experience in datasets nested arbitrarily deep.
<!-- MIH: modularization is presented as #2, but it seems to be just #1 (nesting) described from a different angle -->
<!-- YOH: not sure what #2 here, since in above it is "reproducible execution" in "MIH thinks:".

As for #2 "reproducible execution" - I think we missed such subsection entirely, so I added it:
--> 

**Annotation of changes is not "re-executable".**
Git commit message is a freeform text intended to provide a human-readable description of introduced changes.
Changes themselves are typically represented by a patch (an exact difference between two versions) which could be applied to another version of the text file(s).
Such annotation is not sufficient to introduce changes by following the description, if they cannot be completely represented by such a patch.
<!-- YOH: may be strip above sentence away... I am just trying to lead somehow into "semantic" description of the change.
  E.g. that if author was very good with the description of change, some smart AI could have redone it following the description
  and not the patch.  The simplest analog could be "replaced word X with Y" where the patch would contain exact difference, but
  either will not be applicable or just would miss some Xs if applied to a vastly different version -->
Unlike changes to text documents or source code, which are typically done "manually", data manipulations are most often performed by software.
DataLad exploits this fact and enables automated annotation of changes which result from running an external command.
DataLad creates a commit message which does not only include a human-readable summary, but also a human and machine-readable record of the command invocation which introduced the changes.
This allows for the data "change" to be re-executed to either verify that results reproduce, or to apply such a "change" to a completely different state. 

**Git and git-annex do not necessarily facilitate the best scientific workflow.**
Git and git-annex, being generic tools, come with rich interfaces and allow for a wide range of workflows.
DataLad strives to provide a higher level interface to more efficiently cover typical use cases encountered in the scientific practice than the direct invocation of individual Git and git-annex commands, and to encourage efficient computation and reproducible workflows.
To this end, DataLad is also accompanied by rich documentation [@datalad-handbook:zenodo] to guide a scientist of any technological competency level, and agnostic of the field of science.
<!-- key point thinks MIH: to some degree the handbook also "just" shows how to use git/git-annex to implement concrete processes that are of relevance for science. In some what "figuring out how to do it with git/git-annex is a major contribution, some of it implemented in code (simplified/alternative API), but otherwise written up in English -->

# Overview of the DataLad and its ecosystem

## DataLad core

The `datalad` Python package provides both a Python library and a command line tool which expose core DataLad functionality to fulfill a wide range of dRDM use cases for any domain.
DataLad (see \autoref{fig:one}) operates on DataLad datasets which are just Git (with optional git-annex for data) repositories with additional metadata and configuration.
 
![DataLad: overview of available commands for various parts of the data management process \label{fig:one}](figures/datalad_process.png)

Using Git's submodule mechanism, DataLad embraces and simplifies modular composition of smaller datasets into larger (super)datasets.
With this simple paradigm, DataLad fulfills the YODA principles for reproducible science [@yoda:myyoda] and facilitates efficient access, composition, scalability, reuse, sharing, and reproducibility of results  (see \autoref{fig:two}).

![DataLad datasets all the way down: from publication to raw data \label{fig:two}](figures/datalad-nesting-access.png)

As a testament of scalability, [datasets.datalad.org](http://datasets.datalad.org) provides a DataLad (super)dataset encapsulating thousands of datasets with unified access to over 250 TBs of primarily neural data from a wide range of hosting portals.

## Extensions

Like Git and git-annex, DataLad core not only provides a generic tool not encumbered by a specific field of science or domain, it also establishes the foundation to build specialized solutions on top of.
DataLad extensions mechanism allows to harmoniously extend DataLad's with a domain or technology specific functionality.
Some exemplar extensions include:

- [datalad-container](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-container) [@datalad-container:zenodo] to simplify management and use of Docker and Singularity containers typically containing complete computational environments;
- [datalad-crawler](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-crawler) [@datalad-crawler:zenodo] the functionality which initiated the DataLad project - to automate creation and updates of DataLad datasets from external resources;
- [datalad-neuroimaging](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-neuroimaging) [@datalad-neuroimaging:zenodo] to provide neuroimaging-specific procedures and metadata extractors;
- [datalad-osf](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-osf/) [@datalad-osf:zenodo] to collaborate using DataLad through the Open Science Framework (OSF).

The same mechanism of extensions is used for rapid development of new functionality to later be moved into the main DataLad codebase (e.g., [datalad-metalad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-metalad/)).
[datalad-extensions](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/) repository provides a list of extensions and continuous integration testing of their released versions against released and development versions of the DataLad core. 
[datalad-extension-template](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extension-template) template repository can be used for creating new DataLad extensions.

## External uses and integrations

[comment1]: <> (TODO: probably here cite some examples of scientific papers in the wild which used DataLad)

DataLad can be used as an independent tool as it used by scientists to access and/or manage data (see e.g. @Wittkuhn_2021, @datasets:LAAC-LSCP),
or as a core technology behind another tool or a larger platform.
[TemplateFlow](http://templateflow.github.io/) [@Ciric_2021] uses DataLad for the management of existing and orchestration of new submissions of neuroimaging templates.
[OpenNeuro](http://openneuro.org) uses DataLad for data logistics with data deposition to a public S3 bucket.
[CONP-PCNO](https://github.com/CONP-PCNO/) adopts aforementioned modular composition to deliver a rich collection of datasets with public or restricted access to data.
[ReproMan](http://reproman.repronim.org) integrates with DataLad to provide version control and data logistics.
[www.datalad.org/integrations.html](https://www.datalad.org/integrations.html) provides a more complete list of DataLad usage and integration with other projects, and @Hanke_2021 provides a systematic depiction of DataLad as a dRDM used by a number of projects. 


## Documentation

The DataLad core repository populates [docs.datalad.org](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/) with developer-oriented information and detailed descriptions of command line and Python interfaces.
A comprehensive [DataLad Handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org) [@datalad-handbook:zenodo] provides documentation with numerous usage examples oriented toward novice and advanced users of all backgrounds.

The simplest "prototypical" example is `datalad search haxby` which would install the [datasets.datalad.org](http://datasets.datalad.org) superdataset, and search for datasets mentioning `haxby` anywhere in their metadata records.
Any reported dataset could be immediately installed using `datalad install` command, and data files of interest obtained using `datalad get`.
More use-case driven examples could be found in the [handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/intro.html) [@datalad-handbook:use-cases].

## Installation

The DataLad Handbook provides [installation instructions](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html) for common operating systems.
DataLad releases are distributed through PyPI, Debian, NeuroDebian, brew, and conda-forge.
The [datalad-installer](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-installer/) (also available from PyPI) can be used to streamline the installation of `git-annex`, which cannot be installed via `pip` and thus may need a separate installation on some operating systems.

## Development

DataLad is being developed openly in a public repository ([github.com/datalad/datalad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad)) since its inception in 2013.
At the time of this publication, the repository amassed over 13.5k commits, 2.5k merged PRs, and 2.3k closed (+700 open) issues from over 30 contributors.
Issue tracker, labels, milestones, and pull requests (from personal forks) are used to coordinate development.
DataLad heavily relies on the versatility and stability of the underlying core tools---Git and git-annex.
To avoid reimplementing the wheel and to benefit the git-annex user community at large, many aspects of the desired functionality are and have been implemented directly in git-annex through collaboration with the git-annex developer Joey Hess [@git-annex:projects-datalad].
To guarantee robust operation across various deployments, DataLad heavily utilizes continuous integration platforms (Appveyor, GitHub actions, and Travis CI) for testing DataLad core, building and testing git-annex (in a dedicated [github.com/datalad/git-annex](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex)), and integration testing 
with DataLad extensions ([datalad-extensions](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/)).
